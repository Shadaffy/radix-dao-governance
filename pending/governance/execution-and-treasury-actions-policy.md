# Execution & Treasury Actions Policy

---

## 1. Scope

This document defines:

* How approved proposals are executed
* How treasury actions are carried out
* Who is authorized to execute decisions
* Safeguards around execution and fund usage

---

## 2. Out of Scope

This document does NOT define:

* How proposals are approved (see Proposal & Voting Framework)
* Emergency actions (see Emergency Policy)
* Governance structure (see Charter)

---

## 3. Execution Principles

All execution must follow these principles:

* **Fidelity** — Actions must match the approved proposal
* **Authorization** — Only designated entities may execute
* **Transparency** — All actions must be publicly recorded
* **Reversibility Awareness** — Irreversible actions require higher scrutiny

---

## 4. Types of Execution

### 4.1 On-Chain Execution

* Automated execution via smart contracts
* Triggered by approved proposals
* Preferred where possible

---

### 4.2 Off-Chain Execution

* Legal agreements
* Payments via external systems
* Operational actions

Must follow governance-approved instructions.

---

### 4.3 Hybrid Execution

* Combination of on-chain and off-chain
* Example: on-chain approval + off-chain implementation

---

## 5. Execution Authority

Execution may be carried out by:

* Smart contracts (automated)
* Authorized signers (e.g., multisig)
* Working Groups (within mandate)

---

### 5.1 Role of RAC

* Ensures execution follows approved decisions
* Verifies compliance
* Does NOT independently execute strategic actions

---

### 5.2 Role of Working Groups

* Execute within approved scope
* Manage operational delivery
* Coordinate contributors

---

### 5.3 Role of Authorized Signers

Authorized Signers are responsible for carrying out treasury and legal execution actions approved by governance.

They:
* execute approved actions within defined time limits
* operate under multi-signature controls
* may refuse execution only on defined procedural, legal, or security grounds
* remain accountable to DAO governance

Where RAC determines that a refusal is invalid, or where a proposal remains unexecuted beyond the 10-business-day backstop window defined in the Governance Continuity Framework §4.2, RAC may instruct remaining signers to proceed with execution directly.

Detailed operational rules are defined in the Authorized Signers Operational Rules.

---

### 5.4 Execution of DAO-Wide Roles

Every approved proposal that creates a paid role must designate an executing body responsible for selection, onboarding, and contracting.

* If the role falls within a Working Group's mandate, that Working Group is the executing body.
* If the role is DAO-wide with no natural Working Group home, the proposal must explicitly name the executor — either a specific Working Group or the RAC.

**When the RAC is the designated executor:**

The RAC must publicly document the selection process and publish its selection decision to the governance forum for a 7-day acknowledgement period before the engagement is binding. During this period, any token holder may file a veto challenge under the standard veto mechanism (Proposal & Voting Framework §8) on the grounds that the selection does not comply with the approved proposal.

The RAC may not act as both executor and compliance verifier for the same role. Where the RAC executes a hire, compliance verification responsibility passes to the DAO via the acknowledgement period above.

---

## 6. Treasury Structure

### 6.1 Multi-Account Model

The treasury may consist of:

* Multiple wallets/accounts
* Segmented by purpose (operations, grants, reserves, etc.)

---

### 6.2 Custody Requirements

Treasury systems must:

* Use secure access controls (e.g., multisig)
* Be auditable
* Support transparency

---

## 7. Treasury Actions

### 7.1 Authorized Actions

* Transfers
* Grant disbursements
* Payments to contributors
* Operational expenses

---

### 7.2 Restrictions

Treasury actions must NOT:

* Exceed approved budgets
* Deviate from proposal intent
* Be executed without proper authorization
* Be paid to any recipient whose KYC/AML compliance status is unknown or unverified, where KYC is required under the **Contributor Compensation Policy §3.5**, **Grant Program Policy §4**, or **Legal Wrapper §7A**

---

### 7.3 Cost Models

Treasury disbursements for work-related proposals must specify one of three cost models:

**Model A — Documented expense recovery**
Actual out-of-pocket costs incurred on behalf of the DAO (hosting, tooling, domain fees, travel). Payment is made against submitted receipts or third-party invoices. No labour component.

**Model B — Fixed-rate service delivery**
A flat fee for a defined, verifiable service outcome. The provider uses existing capability (infrastructure, vehicle, skills) acquired independently. The provider volunteers their time and effort; the DAO pays only for the cost of the service output, not for hours worked. No itemized receipts are required — accountability is through outcome verification.

**Model C — Fully compensated work**
Labour plus costs, with defined deliverables, milestones, and reporting obligations. Applies to grants, contractor agreements, and contributor compensation.

---

### 7.4 Payment Documents

All treasury payments must be initiated against a payment document:

* **Invoice** — issued by a registered company or sole trader operating as a business. Must include: provider name and registration details, service description, amount, period covered, and payment address.

* **Monthly claim** — submitted by a private individual. Must include: provider name and wallet address, service description matching the approved proposal, amount, and period covered. No registration details required.

RAC verifies each payment document against the approved proposal before Authorized Signers release payment. Verification confirms: (a) the document matches the approved service and fee, (b) the period claimed has not already been paid, (c) the total does not exceed the authorized commitment.

---

### 7.5 Standing Service Authorization

A governance vote authorizing a recurring fixed-rate service (Model B) constitutes a standing authorization for the full approved term. Authorized Signers may release payment each period upon receipt of a verified claim or invoice without a new governance vote.

Requirements:

* The proposal must state the fee, payment frequency, and maximum term.
* The total authorized commitment (fee × term) is calculated at proposal time and displayed explicitly in the proposal.
* Default maximum term: **6 months**. Longer terms require explicit justification in the proposal.
* At term end, continuation requires a new proposal. RAC may not extend a standing authorization unilaterally.
* The DAO may terminate a standing authorization early via a Governance Process proposal.

---

### 7.6 Treasury Inflows — Donations

The DAO may receive and hold unsolicited, unconditional donations without prior governance approval, provided that:

1. The transfer does not impose any legal, contractual, or operational obligations on the DAO.
2. No rights, ownership claims, or influence over governance are granted in connection with the transfer.
3. The source of funds does not violate applicable law or compliance requirements.

All donations must be:

* Publicly disclosed within **30 days** of receipt, in accordance with the Transparency & Reporting Policy.
* Recorded in treasury reporting.

Authorized Signers may refuse or return funds if:

* The source is reasonably suspected to be unlawful or sanctioned.
* The transfer includes explicit or implicit conditions.
* Acceptance would create material reputational risk.

Any donation that includes conditions, expectations, or earmarked use must be approved via a Governance Proposal before acceptance.

---

## 8. Budget Execution

Each approved budget must include:

* Scope of spending
* Maximum allocation
* Timeframe

---

### 8.1 Spending Within Budget

Working Groups may:

* Allocate funds within approved limits
* Issue RFPs and pay contributors

---

### 8.2 Spending Outside Budget

Requires new governance approval.

---

## 9. Execution Workflow

1. Proposal passes
2. Execution plan confirmed
3. Authorized entity executes
4. Action recorded publicly
5. Outcome reported

---

## 10. Transparency & Reporting

All execution actions must:

* Be publicly visible (on-chain or reported)
* Include sufficient detail for accountability

---

### 10.1 Exceptions

Limited confidentiality is allowed where:

* Required for security
* Required for legal obligations

Confidential actions must be disclosed retrospectively according to the following deadlines:

* **Security-related confidentiality** — no later than **90 days** after the action was taken, or when the security basis no longer applies, whichever is sooner
* **Legal-related confidentiality** — no later than **12 months** after the action was taken, or when the legal proceeding or obligation concludes, whichever is sooner
* Extensions beyond these deadlines require a governance vote

Throughout the confidentiality period the RAC must maintain a confidential record of the action and its basis, which becomes part of the retrospective disclosure.

---

## 11. Verification & Compliance

The RAC is responsible for:

* Verifying execution matches proposal
* Flagging deviations
* Ensuring governance compliance

---

## 12. Execution Failure

If execution fails:

* Issue must be reported
* Root cause identified
* Remediation proposed

---

## 13. Dispute Handling

Execution disputes are resolved via:

* Governance processes
* Dispute Resolution Policy

---

## 14. Irreversible Actions

Actions that cannot be undone (e.g., large transfers) require:

* Clear proposal specification
* Higher scrutiny during review
* Mandatory pre-execution hold — Authorized Signers must not initiate execution of any Treasury / Budget or Executable proposal until the veto window has fully closed (48 hours after vote close, per DAO Parameters §9). High-risk actions (requiring 4-of-5 signers) must additionally observe the extended 72-hour hold defined in DAO Parameters §9. Signers who execute before the hold period expires are in breach of their duties under the Authorized Signers Rules regardless of whether a veto is filed.

---

## 15. Delegation & Sub-Execution

Working Groups may:

* Delegate tasks to contributors
* Create sub-processes

Responsibility remains with the Working Group.

---

## 16. Records & Auditability

All execution must:

* Be recorded
* Be auditable
* Maintain historical traceability

---

## 17. Governance Parameters

Defined separately:

* Spending thresholds
* Multisig requirements
* Execution delays (if any)

---

## 18. Amendments

This policy may be updated via governance.
